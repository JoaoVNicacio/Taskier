# Taskier
## A simple task managing API

### Introduction:
Oh, hello there!
This is Taskier, a project that I build with the intent of learning more about Domain Driven Design, Clean Architecture, Tests and other stuff in C# with ASP.NET.

### Structure:
I decided to do the project using DDD and Clean Architecture in it, so I used one API, Some classlibs and a xUnit project for the layers, all of which are linked in the sln file and I aim to reference them as layers in the parts needed (except for the domain layer which shouldn't reference outer layers)

### Others:
> Disclaimers:
>> I don't have a lot of time in my daily routine, so the progress may be a little spaced.
>> It stills a barebones structure since it is starting recently and I don't have a lot of time available to code for myself :/.
